Task 1. 
A user on the most recent PROS 4 Beta release has found that their program crashes occasionally when trying to get basic telemetry from their robot when they are using motor groups.

Your task: 

1. Create a new PROS 4 project using the CLI (use the --beta flag when creating a project)
2. Refrence the docs page to find likely methods that they have been using
3. Try to get the program to crash
4. make a branch off of THIS BRANCH on the kernel repo with the naming scheme 'YOUR_NAME/training1'
5. Attempt to fix the bug.
6. Write a very brief summary in this doc (on your branch) on what the bug was, and how you solved it (2-3 sentances MAX) And push your code. 
7. If you can, Test your code. Not many of you have NDAs yet, so Feel free to ask me to upload your branch onto a brain to see if it works.
